            <p className="about-text">Programming has almost always been an interest of mine. 
            Whether it was trying to create a game using C# and Unity, 
            or trying to create simple web apps, teenager me was always 
            eager to learn a new technology to create something cool to 
            show off to my friends. Fast forward a couple years and I’m 
            getting ready to graduate University of Arizona’s Full Stack 
            Web Developement Bootcamp. I’ve learned about many essential 
            libraries and frameworks to become employer-competitive and I’m 
            finally ready to enter the job market. Applying what I’ve learned 
            in the past year to real world scenarios to help companies develop 
            creative websites excites me and fuels my passion to learn more and more every day.
            In my free time I love to play guitar and bass, and play video games.
